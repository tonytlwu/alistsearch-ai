# **Case Study: Two Boxes × A-List Search**

## **Company Overview**

**Name:** Two Boxes  
**Founded:** 2022  
**Industry:** E-Commerce Returns Tech / Sustainable Logistics  
**Headquarters:** Denver, Colorado  
**Core Technology:** SaaS Returns Processing Platform  
**Stage:** Series A (Investors include: SuperAngel, Assembly, and Matchbook)  
**Team Size at Engagement:** 11-50 employees

## **The Challenge**

Two Boxes was accelerating revenue growth and needed to hire an Enterprise Account Executive to close their biggest contracts with top-tier customers.  
**Why it was challenging:**

* **Extreme time pressure:** Co-Founder Kyle Bertin was going on paternity leave, creating an urgent deadline to close the search before his departure.  
* **Holiday timing:** The search coincided with the holiday season when most candidates and companies slow down recruiting activity.  
* **Specialized skill set:** The role required 8+ years of enterprise SaaS sales experience with proven ability to close high-value deals.

## **A-List Solution**

A-List partnered directly with Co-Founder Kyle Bertin in an exceptionally responsive, time-sensitive search that prioritized speed without compromising quality.

## **The Result**

**✅ Search completed before Kyle's paternity leave**  
**✅ Hired AE is driving enterprise pipeline and closing high-value contracts**  
**✅ Two Boxes continues to scale across 120+ brands globally**  
**✅ Company recently raised $5.3M Series A to accelerate growth**

*"You do what needs to be done — for example, over the holidays you helped us place a role by getting on calls the day after Christmas. Not a lot of folks are willing to do that kind of thing. That was really impactful for us to keep the business moving forward."*
