**Founded:** 2019

**Industry:** Health Tech/Dementia Care

**Headquarters:** New York City, NY

**Core Technology:** AI/ML/NLP \+ Video Avatars

**Stage:** Seed ($15M raised)

**Team Size at Engagement:** ≈15 employees

## **The Challenge**

elovee was founded with the mission to transform dementia care, combining AI, data science, design, and neuropsychology to deliver comforting voice and visual interactions with loved ones for seniors—available 24/7.

The founders needed to hire a **Head of AI/ML/NLP** who could serve as the technical co-founder—leading the full stack from AI and NLP to mobile and web, while building and scaling a multidisciplinary team.

**Why it was challenging:**

* **Rare skill combination:** The role required deep expertise across AI, machine learning, NLP, video avatar technology, mobile development, and scalable architecture—plus leadership experience to build and manage a team.  
* **Healthcare complexity:** The platform needed to comply with strict healthcare regulations (HIPAA, FSA, GDPR) while delivering innovative technology for a sensitive demographic.  
* **Founder-level role:** This individual would shape company strategy alongside the CEO, requiring entrepreneurial mindset, business acumen, and technical excellence.

## **A-List Solution**

A-List partnered directly with the **CEO** at elovee in a deeply collaborative, mission-driven search.

An iterative process was critical to success—since a role like this really didn't exist at other companies, we had to use creativity and source candidates with the unique combination of deep machine learning and natural language processing experience, with the ability to lead, inspire, and build a team.

**Execution Highlights:**

* Mapped the intersection of AI/ML/NLP expertise to identify the right candidates who aligned with the mission and had scrappy startup experience  
* Leveraged creative sourcing strategies to find leaders with the rare combination of the above

## **The Result**

**✅ Search completed in nine weeks**

**✅ Head of AI/ML/NLP successfully onboarded and leading product strategy**

**✅ MVP launched on schedule with pilot customers onboarded**

*"I didn't want a big agency. I wanted a partner who was hands-on, values-aligned, and understood the pace of change in AI — that's exactly what I found in A-List."*
